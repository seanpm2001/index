# finc Solr schema

The [finc](https://finc.info) Solr schema is a derivative of the [VuFind standard Solr schema](https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind/tree/master/solr/vufind/biblio/conf). It is used by Solr cores that empower discovery systems for libraries of the finc user community, e.g.,  [Leipzig University Library]( http://www.ub.uni-leipzig.de/) (UBL) or [Saxon State and University Library Dresden](https://www.slub-dresden.de/) (SLUB). 
It mainly enables search and result display (i.e. results in the hit list) of bibliographic resources.

Since the finc Solr schema is largely compatible to the VuFind standard Solr schema, it should be easily usable by other [VuFind](https://github.com/vufind-org/vufind) or [TYPO3 Find](https://github.com/subugoe/typo3-find) instances as well.
